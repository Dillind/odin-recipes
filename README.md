Task: To build a basic recipe website


## Final Thoughts:
    During this process, I have learned some basic HTML capabilities, such as the <!DOCTYPE.html> format required at the beginning of each new page. I learned how to use ordered and unordered lists, using different header types, how to insert a link and an image, and how to direct to different folders and files.

    Looking forward for what is to come.
